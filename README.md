# PyChat
PyChat -- A Chat platform written in Python and JavaScript

Currently this code is just for review. Custom instances are not yet supported.

You can see an instance at: https://chat.dj-electro.me

## Why is there no Wiki or issues?
There actually is. I use my own JIRA instance for the Issues, Wiki, and project boards. You can see that at https://jira.djelectro.me. You should go there if you want to report an issue

Pull requests are still always welcome directly to this repo.
